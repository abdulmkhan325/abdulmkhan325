My interests lie at the intersection of DevOps and Data Engineering.

In terms of DevOps side, I have expertise in Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. I am skilled in implementing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and version control with Git. Additionally, I have experience with infrastructure automation using tools like Terraform and Ansible, as well as monitoring and automation practices.

On the Data Engineering, I have hands-on experience with AWS, GCP, and Azure, where I have built ETL and ELT pipelines using tools like Airflow and Spark. I am proficient in SQL and NoSQL databases, and I have a solid understanding of data modelling and data warehousing concepts.

Combining my passion for both DevOps and Data Engineering, I strive to leverage the best practices and tools from both domains to build efficient, scalable, and automated data pipelines and infrastructure.
